US State Quiz App
=================

An app that displays an outline of a U.S. State and asks the user to identify the state. If the user guesses the correct state, a “bonus question” appears asking the user to name the state’s capital. If the user answers correctly, 10 bonus points are added to the score; otherwise, the correct answer is displayed and the app procees to the next state.
